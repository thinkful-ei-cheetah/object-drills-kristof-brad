'use strict';

// 1. Object initializers and methods
// Create an object called loaf using an object initializer ({}) with two properties: flour, which should be set to 300 and water which should be set to 210.
// Use console.log to print the flour and water properties.
// Add an empty method to the loaf object called hydration.
// Fill in the body of the method to return the hydration of the loaf (the water divided by the flour multiplied by 100).
// Call the hydration method and use console.log to print the result.

const loaf = {
  flour: 300,
  water: 210,
  hydration: function (){ 
    return this.water / this.flour * 100;
  },
};

console.log(loaf.flour, loaf.water);
console.log(loaf.hydration());



// 2. Iterating over an object's properties
// Create an object with five properties: foo, bar, fum, quux, and spam. Give each property a unique value of your choosing.
// Loop over the object using for ... in
// Use console.log to show each property name and its associated value.

cont myObj = {
    foo: 2
    bar: 3
    fum: 6
    quux: 9
    spam: 7
}

for (let key in myObj) {
    console.log(key, myObj[key])
}



// 3. Arrays in objects
// Create an object with a property called meals which is an array of strings: 'breakfast', 'second breakfast', 'elevenses', 'lunch', 'afternoon tea', 'dinner', 'supper'.
// Use console.log to show the name of a hobbit's fourth meal of the day.
// Don't forget that humans and hobbits count from 1, but computers count from 0.






// 4. Arrays of objects
// Create 3-5 objects, each with a name and a jobTitle. Use people you know, or characters from fiction, or your own inventions.
// Store these objects in an array.
// Iterate over the array and use console.log to show each person's job title and name.







// 5. Properties that aren't there
// Expand on the previous example by adding a boss property to everyone except the owner of the company.
// Change the iteration to print out messages in this format: "${title} ${name} reports to ${boss}.". For example: Junior Engineer Bob reports to Fred..
// What gets printed out for the owner?
// Adjust the message so that people with no boss display "${title} ${name} doesn't report to anybody." - for example, Founder John doesn't report to anybody.
